About The Project:
Dice Simulator
-This is a python project which imitates an actual dice roll.

This is unique in a few ways:
● We can choose from the different types of dice available based on our desire.
● Standard Die - With equal probability of each number from 1 to 6
● Even biased Die - Will guarantee an even throw like 2,4,6
● Odd biased Die - Will guarantee an odd throw like 1,3,5
● 1 and 6 biased Die - Will only result in a number between 1 or 6 (for people who never get 1 or 6 on an actual die)
● n number of dice can be rolled at a time which gives a series of number as output.
