## About The Project


We have all played Rock, Paper, Scissors with our friends and siblings in our childhood, may it be for choosing who will bat first in a cricket match or to check who will tidy up the room. Rock Paper Scissors was one game we all loved to play. Now with the help of python we can play the same OG Rock, Paper, Scissors with our computer.

## Logic and Usage

The program uses a Difficulty System:
* **Newbie Rock Paper Scissors** (For people who never win) - Probability of the opponent playing either rock, paper or scissors is increased to 50%. This way it becomes very easy to guess the opponents moves and hopefully you will win.

* **Standard Rock Paper Scissors** - Equal probability of rock, paper and scissors i.e there is a 33% probability that the opponent defeats you.
* **Hard Rock Paper Scissors** - Probability that the opponent defeats you is 40%.
* **Extreme Rock Paper Scissors** (not recommended) - Either you defeat your opponent or he defeats you i.e there is no possibility of a draw.
